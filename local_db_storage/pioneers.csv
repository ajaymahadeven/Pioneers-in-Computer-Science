Working on space filling curves, which had earlier attracted the attention of such “greats” as Peano and Hilbert, Jack developed techniques that allowed them to be used in the compression of video data. In this he published widely culminating with the invention of Murray polygons. This research, while ahead of its time when Jack published, has now been taken up industrially by the BBC among others. In all Jack published three books and over fifty papers.",England,20,“mathematics”,https://info.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/student-handbook/images/jack-cole/jack-cole.jpg,"Jack Cole’s academic career started late due to the Second World War but was to span 40 years. Blown up by “friendly fire” in a wartime training exercise, Jack had to learn to write left-handed before entering tertiary education in his early twenties. A first class honours degree in Mathematics at University College, London was followed by the Mayer de Rothschild Scholarship to study for an MSc. Working with his mentor, Professor Harold Davenport, and aided by a London University Scholarship, Jack stayed on to complete a PhD in 1952 on the theory of numbers.

Born within the sound of Bow Bells, Jack proceeded to spend most of his academic career in Scotland and indeed eventually described himself as a “Scot by marriage”. Starting as a lecturer at the then Heriot-Watt College in Edinburgh (1952-6) he moved to Queen’s College, Dundee (1956-62).

Slowly but surely the potential of computer technology lured Jack into a career change and he returned south to the University of Leicester to become Director of the Computing Laboratory (1962-5). However, England did not hold him for long and in 1965 he returned to the University of St Andrews as Director of the Computing Laboratory and Reader in Computational Science.",51.5137,0.0936,,Jack Cole,182,https://info.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/student-handbook/school/jack-cole/,1991

The company would later become a global powerhouse, standing as the world's largest technology firm by revenue and market capitalization. Wozniak's technical genius can be witnessed in the creation of the Apple I and Apple II, the latter being one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. His influence extended to the development of the original Apple Macintosh. After leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak continued to innovate, creating the first programmable universal remote and engaging in various technological and philanthropic endeavors, especially in K-12 education. Even after stepping down from active duties, he maintains a ceremonial association with Apple. Wozniak's influence has expanded over the years to various areas including GPS, telecommunications, technical education, and pop culture conventions.
